The Duplicate File Finder was the initial purpose of this tool, but, while doing it, I've realized that it I could do something better than Finder.
It was an ambicious project which was moving at good pace, till the time that I've changed jobs, and completely lost time to continue its developpment.
Had less and less time to devote to it, and everytime I had to work on it, I was not adding new stuff, but only solving deprecations.
At a given moment, I just gave up. Another point was that I was trying to sell the Duplicate File Finder feature in order to recover some costs.
Apple charges developpers 100USD per year, and I was getting less than that. Financially it was a disaster.

I'm now making this public, for it to be a guide for future developpers on how to implement features.
Although it is written in the old ObjectiveC, most of the ways of interacting with widgets didn't really change with the passage to Swift.
This tool had some success on the App Store, reaching 8000 users at the time.
